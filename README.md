# Vehicle Interface and Car Class - TypeScript Exercise

## Description

This project demonstrates how to define a TypeScript interface and implement it in a class. 

- The `Vehicle` interface defines properties for `make`, `model`, `year` and a `start` method.
- The `Car` class implements the `Vehicle` interface and provides its own implementation of the `start` method.
- An instance of the `Car` class is created and its `start` method is called to verify functionality.

## Files

- `car.ts` — TypeScript source code containing the interface, class, and example usage.
- `car.js` — Compiled JavaScript output after running the TypeScript compiler.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed globally or locally

### Steps
